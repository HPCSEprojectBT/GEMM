Consider the first eigenvalue, lambda = (0.049,1.06)
If v is the corresponding eigenvector, then lambda * v = 
  (0.466,-0.331)
   (0.117,0.137)
   (0.17,-0.456)
(-0.0578,-0.622)
 (-0.152,-0.256)
   (-0.186,0.12)
... and A * v = 
  (0.466,-0.331)
   (0.117,0.137)
   (0.17,-0.456)
(-0.0578,-0.622)
 (-0.152,-0.256)
   (-0.186,0.12)

Finally, V * D * V^(-1) =
